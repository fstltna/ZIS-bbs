This file documents known problems with specific terminals and
workarounds.

Testing is primary done on the linux console and sometimes on xterm; they
both seem to work perfectly.  Since I'm not a terminals wizard I'll make 
the convenient assumtion that other terminals (or curses) aree to blame 
and zis is OK ;-)

nxterm works just as well as xterm.

konsole and gnome-terminal leave debris on screen, especially during
animations.  Disabling animations helps but not completely.  Setting
TERM=vt100 (for black&white interface) or TERM=xterm-color (for colors) in
the envirnoment seems to solve all problems (except for them being so slow
relative to xterm ;-)

rxvt shows black on black (i.e. invisible) text.  This is caused by it
exporting the COLORFGBG environment variable and ncurses paying attention
to it (I didn't figure out who is to blame but the bottom line is that
there is a misunderstanding between them ;-).  Setting COLORFGBG='15;0' 
seems to help; running rxvt -rv (reverse video mode) also solves the 
problem; also with TERM=vt100 it works fine (but without colors).
