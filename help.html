<h3><a name="his">Historical setting</a></h3>
<p>
ZIS is a turn based strategy game for multiple players.  It is a
<b>console</b> version of the game <b>Konquest</b> (a game for KDE) which in
his turn was based on a old game called <b>galactic conquest</b> from 1987
that was a game for MS-DOS (which was actually much more similar to ZIS)
</p>
<h3><a name="atn">About the name</a></h3>
<p>
ZIS is <b>Zionist In Space</b>. The name was based upon a role playing game
that I with Barak Katzir and Tomer Razikovetsky invented in school. The general
idea is sort of a parody about the situation in Israel (where we live). You have
super heroes like <b>Israman</b> and <b>Liberman</b> which are good and you have
<b>Meretzman</b> (based on the name of a local political movement that wants
peace at all costs and easily betraying the country for money or anything else...)
and <b>Yaser</b> who is the leader of the Palestinian autonomy. Well unfortunately
you don't get it in this version because it requires AI but it will appear in the
2.00 version as a <b>single player campign</b>. Because of the fact that the game
is dealing with space and planets... We decided to take the campign into the
'stars' and make it Zionist In <b>Space</b>. But except of several nice maps you
wan't get a lot of related things in the game to I'ts name.
If you have been wandering so yes the game does carries a political cause and
we hope that you will agree but if you don't so that is not our problem you can
just not play it.
</p>
<h3><a name="wit">Well what is it ?</a></h3>
<p>
This is a <b>turn based strategy</b> with up to 64 players which can be played
on one computer. The goal of the game is no less then achieve total dominance
over the <b>galaxy</b> by taking over planets.  planets are producing ships at
a constant rate -> that is the main force the player has in this game. With
the ships he can go and fight for other planets or defend his own. The game
has an ability to save and load games which is good for long games that can
take for up to 5 hours or even more.
</p>
<h3><a name="brs">Basic rules</a></h3>
<p>
There are planets which produce ships on a constant rate.  The planets have
owners e.g. neutral, foo, bar... the player can send ships to other
planets. The ships arrive after a given amount of time (depending on the
distance between the planets).
</p>
<p> The planets have a <b>kill ratio</b> when in battle they kill ratio
determines how efficiently they battle.  Defending ships take the ratio of the
defended planet and attacking ships take the ration of the planet they ware
sent from.  Suppose you have <b>5</b> ships with a kill ratio of <b>0.8</b> and
the enemy has <b>10</b> ships with a kill ratio of <b>0.4</b> the result will
be equal because your kill ratio is twice the size of his kill ratio but he
has twice your ships.  The planet will keep its owner.  Now suppose the you
have <b>10</b> ships with <b>0.3</b> kill ration and the enemy has <b>8</b>
ships with <b>0.75</b> kill ratio.  So your powers are <b>3</b>:<b>6</b> and
he will win.  He will lose half of his ships while you will lose all your
ships.  The same amount of ships becomes more powerful when sent from stronger
planets...
</p>
<p>
There is the <b>morale</b>. The morale affects ship production and base.
construction it is affected by battles that were hard for the planet.<br>
<em>The relation of the ship destruction on planet.</em> the more ships
sombody destroyed on a planet with an attack the more morale decreased on that
planet.
<br>
Morale rises <b>every turn</b>.
</p>
<h3><a name="wig">What is it good for ?!</a></h3>
<p>
Well, I started working on it about 2 weeks from the point when I saw Konquest
because I was quite impressed. ZIS from what I saw is a fine game for 2-5
or even 2-8 people (even if it supports 64) and it is one of the few games
that you can play on a single computer with your friends which is quite rare
because there not that much multi-player games on a single computer which are
worth playing !
</p>
<p>
The good part is that it can be played from 5-10 min when you don't have much
time and even for several hours without losing or stopping. The bad part is
that if you play with more then 4-5 people you have intervals of about
<b>15</b> min from turn to turn and that is quite annoying so I think the best
way to play it is with <b>3-4</b> people.
</p>
<p>
There is a thing that the game currently can't cover: you can't play it alone
as a short relief from your troubles because it doesn't have any AI. However
one is already underway hopefully to be released in future versions.
</p>

<hr>
<center><h2><a name="ui">User interface</a></h2></center>
<p>
Unlike it's predecessor ZIS has a <b>command line styled interface</b> so in
order to play it it is very useful to read this first!  On most occasions it
reads a single character and acts immediately.  Sometimes, e.g. for entering
numbers it reads until you press enter.  Note that in commands of the gameplay
itself (e.g. <b>s</b>end ships) echo of your input is supressed so that the
other players won't see what you do (unless they watch carefully what you
press ;-).  So don't be surprised if nothing appears when you type, it's all
right.
</p>
<p>
This version features a menu which makes the interface quite intuitive.  It's
brought up by F10 or Escape.  When in trouble, F1 or h or ? brings up the
help...
</p>

<h3><a name="gcs">Game commands</a></h3>
<dl compact>





<dt><strong><kbd>p</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
shows you the properties of a given planet but only if it
is controlled by a player, you do not have any intelligence on
neutral planets.

<dt><strong><kbd>s</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
sends from a planet that is under your control to any other
planet a given amount of ships of course if you have them on the planet.
if the planet is under you control they will join the local fleet otherwise
they will battle with the defense fleet for dominance over the planet.

<dt><strong><kbd>t</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
transfers ships from one planet to another between different players, if the
planet of the player that the fleet was supposed to reinforce was conquered
by another player it will make battle with him and if won the planet will
be owned by the original player.

<dt><strong><kbd>f</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
displays for you the relative forces of the players by comparing the
absolute amount of ships and the amount of planets for every player (in a
cute table (-:)

<dt><strong><kbd>a</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
auto-sending from a given planet to a given planet a given amount of ships.
A planet can auto-send to only 1 planet at a time. The auto-send will be
executed in the end of each turn, in case the source planet will not have
enough ships it will send all the remaining ships. you can't know the auto-send
of a planet which doesn't belong to you. 

<dt><strong><kbd>d</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
calculates the distance between two planets and types the amount of turns it
will take to a fleet to cover that distance.

<dt><strong><kbd>m</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
switches what is displayed on the map for each planet.  Normally you see the
name but this can show the number of ships or the production instead, which is
very handy to get an overview of the forces.  Pressing it cycles between the
three modes.

<dt><strong><kbd>e</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
ends the turn of the current player (another 'enter' to confirm). at the end
of a cycle of turns it will display all the events of this turn i.e. planets
being conquered, fleets arrived...
<dt><strong><kbd>b</kbd>:</strong>
<dd>
builds a base on the planet. Depending on the morale of the planet <b>in the time
of building.
</dd>

<dt><strong><kbd>S</kbd>:</strong>
